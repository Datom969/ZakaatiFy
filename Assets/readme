# ZakaatiFy 🧮🌙

**ZakaatiFy** is a personal **portfolio project** focused on building a modern, user-friendly Zakat calculation experience that helps Muslims understand and calculate their Zakat obligations with clarity, confidence, and peace of mind.

The project is currently in **MVP stage**, with most of the core frontend experience already implemented and actively evolving.

---

## ✨ Project Intent

Zakat is an act of worship rooted in precision, trust, and intention. ZakaatiFy aims to:

* Remove confusion around Zakat calculations
* Present financial inputs and outputs clearly and transparently
* Respect different scholarly opinions (e.g. Nisab differences)
* Feel calm, dignified, and trustworthy — not overwhelming

---

## 🚧 Project Status (MVP)

This repository contains an **in-progress MVP built as a portfolio project**.

### ✅ What’s Implemented

* **Homepage**

  * Clear value proposition
  * Educational content around Zakat and Nisab

* **Calculation / Data Entry Page**

  * Structured inputs for assets and liabilities
  * Real-time calculation logic on the frontend

* **Live Net Worth Display**

  * User’s net worth updates instantly as values are entered
  * Designed to give immediate feedback and clarity

* **Frontend Architecture**

  * Modular, clean, and scalable structure
  * Accessibility and UX considered from the start

> Roughly **70% of the frontend** is completed at this stage.

---

###  What’s Not Implemented Yet

These features are intentionally pending due to external dependencies:

* **Gold & Silver Price API Integration**

  * Live Nisab values (gold & silver) not yet fetched
  * Backend work is blocked until a reliable API is finalized

* **Backend Logic**

  * Zakat eligibility confirmation
  * Persistent calculations / summaries

* **Confirmation Page**

  * Final Zakat due breakdown
  * Payment guidance and next steps

---

## Why the Backend Is Paused

Zakat calculations rely heavily on **accurate, up-to-date Nisab values**.

Until a stable and trustworthy **gold & silver pricing API** is integrated:

* Backend calculations would be incomplete
* Final confirmation would risk inaccuracies

For this reason, development is proceeding **frontend-first**, ensuring the user experience and calculation flow are solid before locking in backend logic.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

> Subject to refinement as the project evolves

* **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
* **Tailwind CSS** for styling
* **Vanilla JS** for calculation logic (MVP stage)
* Planned backend: **Firebase / Node.js** (not yet active)

---

## 📌 Learning & Development Roadmap

High-level next steps:

1. Integrate reliable gold & silver price API
2. Implement backend calculation logic
3. Build confirmation & summary page
4. Add scholarly context (Nisab explanations, Madhhab views)
5. Improve validation, accessibility, and edge-case handling
6. Prepare for beta release

---

## Feedback

This project is still in its early stages.

Thoughtful feedback is welcome — especially around:

* Zakat calculation accuracy
* UX clarity for financial inputs
* API recommendations for precious metals pricing

Please open an issue or discussion before submitting major changes.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

ZakaatiFy is **not a replacement for scholarly advice**.

While the goal is accuracy and transparency, users are encouraged to consult qualified scholars for personal or complex Zakat situations.

---

## Closing Note

ZakaatiFy is being built with care, intention, and respect for the weight of Zakat as an obligation.

This MVP represents the foundation — more refinement, verification, and polish will follow, in shā’ Allāh.

This project is part of my growing frontend and web application portfolio. Feedback is always appreciated.
